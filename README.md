# Music-Playlist-Organizer
A program that allows users to organize their music playlist.

# This is my first Python project(designed by ChatGPT)
The program demonstrates basic list manipulation in Python, including creating lists, accessing elements, calculating list size, removing items, and adding items. It also showcases string manipulation methods like title() and list methods like pop() and append().

# It does the following: 
## It creates a list called songs containing the titles of several songs.
## It assigns the songs list to the playlist variable.
## It prints the playlist, which displays all the songs in the list.
## It calculates the size of the playlist using len(playlist) and prints the result, which is the number of songs in the playlist.
## It assigns the artist's name "TP OK Jazz" to the artist variable and prints it with the title() method, which capitalizes the first letter of each word.
## It assigns the title of the first song in the songs list to the currently_playing variable and prints a message indicating the currently playing song, including the artist's name in uppercase.
## It removes the last song from the songs list using the pop() method, which removes and returns the last item in the list.
## It adds a new song called "Mario" to the end of the songs list using the append() method.
## It prints the updated songs list, which now includes the new song "Mario" and excludes the last song that was removed.
